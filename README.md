# 💾 Database Projects Portfolio

This repository contains my projects and exercises focusing on relational database design, SQL programming, Java database connectivity (JDBC), and building graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for data management systems.

All projects were developed using **SQLite** for the database engine and **Java** (primarily within the Eclipse and BlueJ environments) for application development.

## 🚀 Key Skills Demonstrated

This portfolio showcases hands-on experience in the following core areas:

* **Database Design:** Translating business requirements into normalized database schemas (ERDs).
* **SQL Mastery:** Writing complex queries, stored procedures, triggers, and defining relationships (Primary/Foreign Keys).
* **JDBC (Java Database Connectivity):** Connecting Java applications to a database to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
* **GUI Development:** Using Java (Swing or JavaFX) to build user-friendly interfaces for data interaction.
* **Data Integrity & Validation:** Implementing rules to ensure data accuracy and consistency.

## 📂 Project Structure

Each project is organized into its own folder and includes three mandatory files:

1.  **`README.md` (Project Specific):** A detailed explanation of that project's goals, technologies, and results.
2.  **`schema.sql` (or `create_db.sql`):** The SQL script required to build the database tables from scratch.
3.  **Source Code:** The Java files (`.java`) that contain the GUI and JDBC connection logic.

### Featured Projects:

* **[Project 1: Library Management System]**
    * *Description:* An application built with Java GUI that allows users to check out, return, and manage book and member records stored in an SQLite database.
* **[Project 2: Employee Payroll System]**
    * *Description:* Focuses on designing a complex relational schema to handle various employee types, pay grades, and tax deductions. Pure SQL exercise.
* **[Project 3: Student Enrollment GUI]**
    * *Description:* A simple CRUD application used to demonstrate robust data validation between a Java form and the database.

## 🔒 Configuration

This repository uses a customized `.gitignore` file to ensure a clean commit history by ignoring compiled Java files (`*.class`), temporary IDE files (Eclipse/BlueJ), and local SQLite database files (`*.db`).
